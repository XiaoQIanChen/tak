# t@k
This is a project of a website called "t@k".

About the site:
This is my first website I ever made, and I'm currently doing this with my friend Sam. This website would be something like a blog for now, and maybe kinda "upgrade" it later on. After we decided the name of "t@k", I googled "what does tak stand for", and it turns out: "The Asian Kids", and, yeah, we are asians :) Don't be racist!


About us:
Me(Terry): I have no expereience on web building, and I'm learning to use html and css now. Pascal is the very first programming I learnt, and then I started use C to solve some online programming problems(algorithms). I am currently learning python 3 in school, with Sam.

Sam: He is a really cool guy. He has learnt some php, and has created a website(cool!)
